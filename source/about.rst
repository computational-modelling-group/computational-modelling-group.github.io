About Southampton's Computational Modelling Group (CMG)
-------------------------------------------------------

The Computational Modelling Group brings together researchers, engineers, staff
and students from across the University of Southampton working with computer
simulation, data analysis, artificial intelligence, high performance computing,
and more generally research projects that have software engineering aspects.

The computational modelling group members are united by their research and use
of computational methods, and apply these tools to advance our understanding
of a wide range of topics such as physical sciences, engineering, medicine,
society, economy and management.

In the period from the `inception of the group in 2009 <https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/about/>`__
to 2024, about 1500 PhD students, research fellows and academics have been
`group members <https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/>`__, and have benefited from the support,
`networking and training opportunities <https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/events/past?page=all>`__
that the community can provide across a wide range of
`research domains <https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/research/>`__.
At the end of 2024, the community-editable web pages at https://cmg.soton.ac.uk have been
retired and now serve as a read-only archive.

Based on that computational community two Centres for Doctoral Training
were attracted
(`Doctoral Training Center Complex Systems and Institute for Complex Systems
Simulations <http://www.icss.soton.ac.uk/>`__, `Center for Doctoral Training in
Next Generation Computational Modelling <https://www.ngcm.soton.ac.uk/>`__)
which together trained 118 PhD students in the field. The
`Research Software Engineering community emerged <https://www.software.ac.uk/about/research-software-engineers>`__
in parallel, and today many of the former
Southampton PhD students from the Computational Modelling Group are working as
Research Software Engineers as experts connecting software engineering with
scientific research.

The Computational Modelling Group was founded in 2009 by Hans Fangohr with the
aim to bring together all research at the university that involves computational
methods, research and analysis. Many of the group members are users of the
University's, national and international supercomputers, but significant
computational research takes place on more modest hardware, and this activity is
explicitly included in the group's remit.

A key aim of the group was to enable networking between traditionally disjoint
faculties and disciplines: often the same computational problem or technique and
exists in multiple discplines, but might be known under different names.
Computational training needs for PhD students and researchers are similar in
different disciplines, and the group tries to streamline this across the
university. The group also demonstrates critical mass in computational modelling
at Southampton to research councils, industry and other parties.

15 years later, these ambitions have been (at least partly) achieved,
computational methods have become the `third pillar of science
<https://physicsworld.com/a/the-third-pillar-of-science/>`__ (next to experiment
and theory), and are embedded in most research activities -- much reducing the
need for the networking opportunities the computational modelling group provided.

From 2025 onwards, the home page and contact point for remaining CMG activities is
